 >> public
    : all the files of css and js and img which will
      be served to the browser will be transpiled with
      the help of bundlers and other tools
      Note* frameworks and libraries like react do this 
            transpiling for us automatically.
      Note* only files present in public folder will be listed in index.js
            for browser.

 >> app
    : all the dev(api) logic will live here like routes/api calls
      in controllers and middlewares inside http folder
      and backend models in models folder and other config 
      Note* project follows MVC (model view controllers) architecture.

 >> app/resources
    : all the dev(client) uncompiled view of the app/project will live here like 
      saas , unbundled js or unoptimized img (if exists) will be here.

    >> app/resources/js
       : will have all the client code of js
         Note* the bundlers and other tools will compile and transpile
               the client code into public folder to be used on browser.
   
    >> app/resources/scss
       : will have all the client code of scss
         Note* the bundlers and other tools will compile and transpile
               the client code into public folder to be used on browser.

    >> app/resources/views
       : will have all the pages/templates here like cart, home, login, signup
         admin-dashboard, basically all the pages.

      provide html pages from here.

    > routes/web.js
      : will have all web routes
    > routes/api.js
      : will have all api routes

 > server.js
   : the entry point of server (app's backend)
   
     Note* server is the one which gives/renders html to browser when requested
           also known as server-side-rendering. 
           (frameworks like Next.js use this under the hood).
   
     Note* in express everything has to be told or registered to app from express
           like ejs template , json data sharing, or any other middlewares ,
           and views(our client side code) also.

     Note* for every middlewares in express we use like (app.use(expressLayout))
           and for every feature we need to set the key-value like (app.set('view engine', 'ejs)).
